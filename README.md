## Installation

To set up the project locally, you will need a working Python environment (Python 3.10+ recommended).

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VimWei/MarkdownAll
   ```
2. **Install Python venv:**
   ```bash
   # 2.1 Intasll uv
   ## Windows (PowerShell)
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ## Linux/macOS
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

   # 2.2 sync python environment
   cd MarkdownAll
   uv sync
   ```
3. **Install Playwright browsers:**
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

## Usage

### Launching the Application

Option 1: (Windows/Linux/macOS) Command line:
```bash
uv run markdownall
```
Option 2: (Windows only) Double-click launcher file `MarkdownAll.pyw` — it starts
without a console window. The start-up splash screen still appears while the app
loads. First run (before `.venv` exists) opens a visible window so the uv setup
is visible; runtime output and errors are written to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\MarkdownAll\launcher.log`.

### Basic Usage

**Converting Articles:**
1. Add URLs to the list using the input field and "Add +" button
2. Set your output directory using "Browse…" 
3. Configure options in the "Webpage" tab (optional):
   * **Download Images:** Recommended for complete offline archives
   * **Speed Mode:** Enable for faster batch processing
   * **Proxy/SSL:** Configure if needed for your network environment
4. Click "Convert to Markdown" to start the process

**Tips:**
- Use up/down arrows to reorder URLs before conversion
- Enable "Filter Non-content Elements" for cleaner Generic Handler results
- Check the log panel for real-time conversion progress and status
